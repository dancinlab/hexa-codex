## 2026-05-23 — ECONOMICS 3-pillar cross-cutter added

A new `verify/numerics_economics_cross_pillar.hexa` (10 checks, all
PASS) ties the three ECONOMICS verbs to one n=6 lattice — sister of
the general `verify/numerics_cross_pillar.hexa` (which only covers the
four F-CODEX falsifiers). The 10 checks:

| # | Check                                                                  |
|--:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | lattice closure σ·φ = n·τ = J₂ = 24 (shared by all 3 verbs)            |
| 2 | train_cost exponent recovery — `N6_EXP·(J₂+1) = J₂` (24/25 · 25 = 24) |
| 3 | infer_cost exponent recovery — `τ·n = J₂` (4 · 6 = 24)                |
| 4 | quality_scale exponent recovery — `α·σ = φ = 2` AND `α = β`            |
| 5 | exponent triad ordering — 0 < α (1/6) < N6_EXP (24/25) < 1 < τ (4)     |
| 6 | 3-pillar composite at Chinchilla 70B / 1.4T / 8k — all 3 finite > 0    |
| 7 | quality⟂infer orthogonality — quality free of ctx, infer free of (N,D) |
| 8 | quality halving rule — `red_term(A,2N,α) / red_term(A,N,α) = 2^-α`    |
| 9 | train doubling rule — `train_cost(N,2D) / train_cost(N,D) = 2^N6_EXP` |
|10 | n6-vs-measured triple gap — quality·train·infer all distinct from emp. |

Wired into `verify/run_all.hexa` (38 → 39 subject scripts),
`verify/lint_numerics.hexa` (green core 17 → 18), and
`tests/test_all.hexa` (29 → 30 cases).

## 2026-05-23 — quality_scale §3 verify ladder closed

`quality_scale` gains its full recipe §3 verification ladder — the
first non-falsifier ECONOMICS verb to reach §3 closure:

- T1 — `verify/calc_quality_scale.hexa` (8 algebraic checks)
- T2 — `verify/numerics_quality_scale.hexa` + `_solver.hexa` (10 + 10)
- T3 — `verify/numerics_quality_scale_parity.hexa` (10 checks)

The ladder fits the Chinchilla loss surface `loss = E + A·N^-α + B·D^-β`
with the n=6 lattice exponent `α = β = φ(6)/σ(6) = 1/6`. T2 verifies
loss-surface shape only (monotone decreasing, floored at the
irreducible loss E) — the Chinchilla A/B coefficients pair with a
measured ≈0.34 exponent, not the n=6 1/6, so absolute loss is
intentionally not asserted. T3 ties the 1/6 exponent to the geometric
mean of the Kaplan-2020 and Hoffmann-2022 published loss-scaling
exponents. Commits `89e810d` (T1), `80136fe` (T2/T3), `46b0971`
(verify-surface restoration).

## 2026-05-23 — domain doc opened

`ECONOMICS.md` / `ECONOMICS.log.md` created in the per-domain root-SSOT
restructure (alongside `SAFETY` / `OPS` / `SUBSTRATE`). The economics
group itself is unchanged — 3 verbs, spec-first, since v1.0.0.

## 2026-05-06 — v1.0.0 seed (Cycle 0)

3 economics verbs extracted unchanged from
`canon@c0f1f570:domains/cognitive/`: `train_cost` · `infer_cost` ·
`quality_scale`. Part of the 17-verb / 4-group seed. Commit `63e8283`.

## v1.0.0 — F-CODEX-1 / F-CODEX-2 arithmetic floors PASS

`training_cost ∝ N^24` (F-CODEX-1) and `inference_cost ∝ context^4`
(F-CODEX-2) closed-form floors verified by `verify/falsifier_check.py` —
the algebraic identity `σ·φ = n·τ = J₂ = 24` is self-proving. Empirical
curve fits PENDING — F-CODEX-1 → v1.2.0, F-CODEX-2 → v1.3.0.

---

_Next: v1.2.0 (2026-10, PLANNED) — wire the economics verbs, ship the
training/inference cost scaling fit, land F-CODEX-1 empirical. Append
round entries here as the group progresses._
